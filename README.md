Here's an example output of the Rock-Paper-Scissors program:



Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors) or 'quit' to stop playing:
rock
Computer chose: scissors
Rock crushes scissors. You win!
Score - You: 1, Computer: 0


Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors) or 'quit' to stop playing:
paper
Computer chose: rock
Paper covers rock. You win!
Score - You: 2, Computer: 0


Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors) or 'quit' to stop playing:
scissors
Computer chose: paper
Scissors cut paper. You win!
Score - You: 3, Computer: 0


Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors) or 'quit' to stop playing:
rock
Computer chose: rock
It's a tie!
Score - You: 3, Computer: 0


Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors) or 'quit' to stop playing:
quit


The output shows:


1. User input and computer choice.
2. Game outcome message (win, lose, or tie).
3. Updated score after each game.


Note: The computer's choices are randomly generated, so the output will vary each time you run the program.


Here are some possible game outcomes:


- Rock vs. Scissors: Rock wins
- Rock vs. Paper: Paper wins
- Scissors vs. Paper: Scissors wins
- Same choices: Tie
